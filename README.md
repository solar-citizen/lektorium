<h1> :small_orange_diamond: Task 2: Drag & Drop </h1>

<p> I created a drag and drop app on React. </p>
<p> A code is a bit dirty and far from best practices, but it works. </p>

<p>You're able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> create figures by double clicking on visible area of the app. </li>
  <li> delete figures by clicking on figure's 'Delete' button. </li>
  <li> drag figures by holding LMB on figure. </li>
  <li> change figure's name by clicking on it's name and then on input field. </li>
  <li> change figure's color by clicking on it's 'Random color' button. </li>
  <li> switch between square and circle form of figure by clicking on it's respective button. </li>
</ul>

<p> Every change you make is saved to local storage. </p>

<p> 'Reset' button clears the field. </p>
